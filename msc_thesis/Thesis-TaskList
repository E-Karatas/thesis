T0 prediction (we have computed T0 for every alloy with TC)	composition features
Ms prediction	composition features
Predict the iron equivalent number	composition features
Classification of the deformation mechanism

Composition features 	shape strain 1, 2, 3	elemental features from matminer

Start with the most simple model before exploring more complex ones
Try logistic regression classification sklearn (scikit-learn linear models)
Random tree
Random forest

Prediction on unseen alloys as the very last step

LASSO
symbolsk regressions algoritme/metode

make a full machine learning framework that takes only composition based features and 
predicts the lattice parameters 
because we can use these to calculate the transformation and dilatation strain

put in 4 classes in matlab table, make classification algorithm using composition features, T0
and the two transformation strains (maybe also include features from matminer like the bulk and shear modulus).
